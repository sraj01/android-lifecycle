Running the Application
Open the project in Android Studio.
Connect your Android device or start an emulator.
Build and run the application.
Understanding the Code
The main logic of this demonstration is implemented in the MainActivity.java file. Here, we have overridden various lifecycle methods of the Android Activity class and added print messages to each method. This helps in understanding the sequence of method calls during the lifecycle of an Android application.
